# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a classic game of tic-tac-toe written in C and played on the console window. 
This is a one-player game, played against the computer.
The goal of this game is to get three of your pieces in a row, column, or diagonal.

At the start of the game, the user may select a difficulty for the computer, either easy or hard.
The first turn is assigned randomly to either the user or the computer.
Once play begins the user must select a space to move to, as labeled on the board.

The game concludes when either the user wins, the computer wins, or it is a draw.
The user is then prompted to play again, if they so choose.
